### Key Information

Please take time to review this information carefully. This is a
research study. Your participation in this study is voluntary which
means that you may choose not to participate at any time. You may ask
questions to the researchers about the study whenever you would like. If
you decide to take part in the study, you will be asked to sign this
form, be sure you understand what you will do and any possible risks or
benefits. The purpose of this research is to learn about how people make
energy-related decisions. Study will last no more than 60 minutes.

### What is the purpose of this study?

The purpose of this study is to pilot the instructions, verbiage, and
interactions of a study planned to research how people make
energy-related decisions in a group environment. We would like to enroll
up to 50 people in this pilot.

### What will I do if I choose to be in this study?

Your participation will engage you in an energy conservation game with
simulated players and give us feedback at every step of the way. Please
notify us of all issues (technical, linguistic, comprehension, etc.),
questions, or concerns you may have about any part of out study.

You will first read the instructions on how to play the game and you'll
be asked to answer a few questions about the instructions to make sure
you understood the rules of the game. Then you will complete one or more
games in which you will make decisions as a resident of a group of
households trying to achieve an energy conservation goal. Depending on
your energy choices and those of others, you will earn a smaller or
larger financial bonus.

### What are the possible risks or discomfort

Breach of confidentiality is a potential risk for all research. The
researchers have taken actions to minimize this risk. The safeguards to
prevent such a risk can be found in the Confidentiality section of the
form. There are no additional risks from the study more serious than
those in everyday life.

### Are there any potential benefits?

Despite the game instructions promising a carbon offset, there will not
be any such benefit during this pilot. Actual air pollution reduction
benefits will be used when the study is finalized and launched for data
collection.

### What alternatives are available

You may choose not to participate in this study.

### Will I receive payment or other incentive?

You will earn a \$10 Amazon voucher from participating in this study.
Depending on your decisions and those of the other participants in the
task during the exercise, you may earn additional funds.

### Will information about me and my participation be kept confidential

You will not be asked to provide your name or any other identifying
information during the study. Data from these experiments will be
retained electronically on a password protected computer, identified
only by participant numbers (anonymized strings with no personal
information), and accessed only by members of the research team. Your
voice will be marked and transcribed. No personal data will be
collected. This data will be retained past the end of the project for
replicability of any published results and possible future analysis. The
project's research records may be reviewed by the National Science
Foundation and by departments at Purdue University responsible for
regulatory and research oversight.

### What are my rights if I take part in this study

Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may choose not to
participate or, if you agree to participate, you can withdraw your

Outline
=======

Many communities in the US are trying to use less energy. In this
experiment, you will play an energy conservation game with other
players. Before you play the game you will review the following:

1.  Instructions on how to play the energy conservation game.
2.  Example scenarios of different game outcomes.
3.  A trial game (just 2 decision rounds)
4.  A comprehension quiz (includes extra pay for correct answers).

**Please read the following rules carefully**, because they will
influence how large a payment you earn at the end.


---


Introduction
============

In this energy conservation game, you and [24]{.game-variable} other
players live in an apartment building that is **trying to reduce its
non-essential energy use by** [60%]{.game-variable}.

You have [6]{.game-variable} months ([6]{.game-variable} decision
rounds) to achieve this goal.

Your decisions affect both: **your cash earnings** from the experiment,
and **actual air pollution in the US**.

Note that all money dedicated to energy conservation will be **invested
through Carbonfund.org** to a program that actually eliminates pollution
from the air in the US.

---


Instruction: Game Structure and Incentives
=========================

-   There are **24 players** who live in the same
    housing community.

-   At the start of each month, each player has **10 energy tokens**
    (worth **$0.01 each**) that represent non-essential energy use
    beyond their basic needs.

-   Each month, every player faces the same **decision problem:** how much
    energy to use for their private benefit (by putting tokens in their
    private account) versus how much to
    conserve (by putting tokens in the group conservation
    account).

-   **Players will be paid** the value of all energy tokens in their
    private account at the end of the game.

-   If the group meets the [60%]{.game-variable} conservation goal by
    the end of the game, then the value of those tokens in the group
    conservation account is doubled and given in equal shares to all
    players as a **bonus**. If the 60% goal is not met, there is not bonus.

-   To meet the [60%]{.game-variable} energy reduction goal, each player
    should contribute **6 energy tokens every month**
    to the group conservation account.



---


Instruction: Gameplay
=====================

-   **In each month** all players are asked simultaneously:
    "How much energy do you want to contribute to group conservation account this month?"
    You may choose to contribute anywhere from 0 to 10 of your monthly energy tokens.
    The remaining tokens will be put in your private account.

-   **After each month** (once all players have made their choices) the
    month's results will be displayed to all players. You'll get updates
    on the group conservation account, other player's contributions,
    and your private account. This feedback is anonymized.

-   **At the end of the game** (after [6]{.game-variable} months) each
    player will be paid based on the rules described on the next page.



---


Instruction: Financial Outcomes
===============================

Tokens in Private Account  +  Group Conservation Bonus  =  Your pay at the end of the game.

-   Regardless of the group goal, all players receive
    [\$0.01]{.game-variable} for every energy token left in their
    [private accounts]{.color-private .font-bold} at the end of the
    game.

-   If the group fails to meet its group conservation goal, **no bonus**
    will be paid to any player.

-   If the 60% group conservation goal is met (i.e., there are at least
    900 tokens in the group conservation account at the end of the game),
    then the building owner **doubles** the monetary value of the
    conserved tokens and **divides them equally** among all 24 players as a bonus.

    > For example, if [900]{.game-variable} tokens are contributed to
    > the group conservation account, each player will receive an
    > additional bonus pay of \$0.72, which is their equal share of the
    > \$18 group bonus (\$18.00 = [900]{.game-variable} tokens in the
    > group conservation account × [2]{.game-variable} ×
    > [\$0.01]{.game-variable} per token).


---


Instruction: Environmental Outcomes
===================================

    Tokens in Group
    Conservation Account  x  $0.01  =  Carbon Offset

-   The monetary value of the energy tokens in the [group conservation
    account]{.color-carbon .font-bold} at the end of the game will
    used to pay for programs through Carbonfund.org that reduce air
    pollution in the US at the rate of 220 pounds for each 100 tokens
    (\$1.00).

-   All contributions to the conservation account will go toward
    pollution reduction, **even if the group does not meet its
    conservation goal**.


---


Examples {#examples-overview .card-title}
==================

Next, we'll show you 5 examples of how the game might be played and what
the results would look like in each scenario.


---


Example 1: Minimum Requirement to Meet the Goal
================================

Example 1 shows the result if **everyone contributes 60%** of their energy tokens toward the
conservation goal, the minimum required to meet the group goal.


---


Examples 2 and 3: Min and Max Conservation
===========================================

Example 2 shows the result if **everyone contributes NO energy tokens** toward the conservation goal,
and Example 3 shows the highest possible pay to all players that results from **everyone contributing
ALL of their energy tokens** to the conservation goal.


---


Examples 4 and 5: Only You vs. Everyone But You
================================================

Example 4 shows the results if **ONLY YOU contribute** tokens toward the conservation goal
(all others contribute 0 tokens in each round), and Example 5 shows the results if **ONLY YOU
DON’T contribute** any energy tokens to the conservation goal, but all 24 other players
contribute ALL of theirs.

Thank you for participating in this study.

**This study involved deception.** This means that we did not provide
you with the complete description of the purpose of the study and some
of the methods or instruments used had a different purpose than how we
described them. Deception is used in research when knowledge of the
purpose of the study or certain aspects of the study may bias
participant responses. Deception involves either false information – a
"cover story" – or omission of certain information. The purpose of this
form is to explain the true purpose of the study and/or provide
information that had been omitted. You also will be asked permission to
use the information we obtained from you during your participation.

**IN SHORT:** We did not tell you that you played against agents (vs.
other people) that were programmed to play with specific levels of
cooperation in order to better analyze participants' conservation
choices. We initially omitted this information from you because we did
not want to bias your responses.

**LONG EXPLANATION:** We seek to understand how visual and textual cues
in energy feedback affect peoples’ cooperative decisions in social
energy conservation contexts. To do this, we have to study individual
decision making in a group context. Group dynamics; however, often leads
to high variability making it very difficult to get statistically
significant results. To be able to test our hypotheses we held the
social context constant for all of our participants. Meaning, all
participants played with the exact same set of agents whose behaviors
emulated actual human behavior based on past empirical research. We
initially omitted this information from you because we did not want to
bias your responses.

Now that you understand the true nature of our study, you have the
chance to refuse the use of the data we collected from you for research
purposes. You are free to ask us not to use your data in our study
analysis. If you decline to let us use your data, you will still receive
the monetary compensation just as you would if we use your data in our
analysis. This is entirely voluntary, but we hope to analyze as much
data as possible to better understand how textual and visual cues may
enhance sustainable cooperation in communities.

**Because this experiment is ongoing, we request that you not share the
true nature and purpose of this experiment with others who might
potentially participate in our study.**
