            There are <strong><span class="game-variable">{{ game_players }}</span> players</strong> who live in the same housing community.
          </li>

          <li>
            At the start of each month, each player has <strong><span class="game-variable">{{ game_tokens }}</span>
            energy tokens</strong> (worth<strong> $<span class="game-variable">{{ token_value }}</span>
            each</strong>) that represent potential energy use beyond their basic needs.
          </li>

          <li>
            Each month, every player faces the same <strong>decision problem</strong>:
            how much energy to use for their personal benefit (by putting tokens in
            their private account) versus how much to conserve (by putting tokens in the
            group conservation account).
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Players will be paid</strong> the value of all energy tokens in
            their private account at the end of the game.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the group meets the <span class="game-variable">{{ reduction_goal }}%</span> conservation goal by the end of the game, then the value of those tokens in
            the group conservation account is doubled and given in equal shares to all
            players as a <strong>reward</strong>.
          </li>

          <li>
            To meet the <span class="game-variable">{{ reduction_goal }}%</span> energy reduction goal, each player should contribute
            <strong><span class="game-variable">{{ optimal_contribution }}</span> energy tokens every month</strong> to the group conservation
            account.
