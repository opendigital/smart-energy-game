<ul>
  <li>
    There are <strong><span class="game-variable">{{ game_players }}</span> players</strong> who live in the same housing community.
  </li>

  <li>
    At the start of each month, each player has <strong><span class="game-variable">{{ game_tokens }}</span>
    energy tokens</strong> (worth<strong> $<span class="game-variable">{{ token_value }}</span>
    each</strong>) that represent potential energy use beyond their basic needs.
  </li>

  <li>
    Each month, every player faces the same <strong>decision problem</strong>:
    how much energy to use for their personal benefit (by putting tokens in
    their private account) versus how much to conserve (by putting tokens in the
    group conservation account).
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Players will be paid</strong> the value of all energy tokens in
    their private account at the end of the game.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the group meets the <span class="game-variable">{{ reduction_goal }}%</span> conservation goal by the end of the game, then the value of those tokens in
    the group conservation account is doubled and given in equal shares to all
    players as a <strong>reward</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    To meet the <span class="game-variable">{{ reduction_goal }}%</span> energy reduction goal, each player should contribute
    <strong><span class="game-variable">{{ optimal_contribution }}</span> energy tokens every month</strong> to the group conservation
    account.
  </li>
</ul>
