              value of the conserved tokens and divides them equally among all
              <span class="game-variable">{{ game_players }}</span> players as a bonus.

                For example, if exactly <span class="game-variable">{{ token_goal }}</span> tokens are
                contributed to the group conservation account, each player will receive an additional
                bonus pay of $0.72, which is their equal share of the $18 group bonus ($18 = <span class="game-variable">{{ token_goal }}</span> tokens
                in the group conservation account x <span class="game-variable">2</span> x <span class="game-variable">${{ token_value }}</span> per token).
