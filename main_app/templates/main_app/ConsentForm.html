            <strong>Study purpose:</strong> The purpose of this research is to learn about how people make
            energy-related decisions in a group environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What will I do?</strong> Your participation will involve answering some survey questions and
            completing a game in which you will make decisions as if you are a resident of a building trying to achieve
            a group energy conservation goal. Depending on your energy choices and those of others in your building, you
            will earn a smaller or larger financial incentive. Participation in this research project is voluntary and
            open to those aged 18 and older. You are free to stop participating at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Study length:</strong> You can take approximately 60 minutes to complete the study.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Possible risks:</strong> Breach of confidentiality is a potential risk for all research. The
            researchers have taken actions to minimize this risk. The safeguards to prevent such a risk can be found in
            the Confidentiality section of the form. There are no additional risks from the study more serious than
            those in everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Potential benefits:</strong> There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this research
            study. There may be benefits to general knowledge about how consumers perceive and use energy devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Alternative:</strong> You may choose not to participate in this study.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Payment and other incentives:</strong> Depending on your decisions and those of the other
            participants in the task, you will earn a minimum of $0.50 from participating in this experiment. Depending
            on your and others’ choices, you may earn well above $0.50.  The credit will be applied to your Amazon
            M-Turk account.
        <p>
            <strong>Confidentiality:</strong> You will not be asked to provide your name or any other identifying
            information during the study. Our HITs are external to Amazon’s servers. Data from these experiments will be
            retained electronically on a password protected computer, identified only by the Worker IDs (anonymized
            strings with no personal information), and accessed only by members of the research team. This data will be
            retained past the end of the project for replicability of any published results and possible future
            analysis. The project's research records may be reviewed by the National Science Foundation and by
            departments at Purdue University responsible for regulatory and research oversight .
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>My rights:</strong> Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may choose not to participate
            or, if you agree to participate, you can withdraw your participation at any time without penalty.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Contact:</strong> If you have questions, comments or concerns about this research project, you can
