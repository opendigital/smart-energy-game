                      <strong>In each month</strong> all players are asked simultaneously: "How
                      much energy do you want to conserve this month?" You may choose to conserve
                      anywhere from 0 to 10 of your monthly energy tokens, keeping the other
                      tokens in your private account.

                      the month's results will be displayed to all players. You'll get updates on
                      the <strong>group conservation account</strong>, other player's
                      contributions, and your private account. Players' feedback to the group is
                      anonymous.

                      paid based on the rules described on the next page.
